==========================================================

Pending and considered changes for `JODDOC`.
The base 36 GUID key is stable over the lifetime of a task
and may appear in other TODO lists.

`[begin-todo]`

1. `<_8eqhngla9u1tfvrj1hh1w46nv_>` In the building JOD appendix clearly explain how to run `setbuilddirs`. I just spent a few
   hours debugging a full build in a new environment only to discover I solved this problem
   years ago with this verb. (DONE)

2. `<_0nftaohr05yjz568p4t88xh3v_>` Update the `datatype` verb to include the new numeric types introduced with J 9.6 (DONE)

3. `<_a7ls2xsoxx8vp89y5olm2u0h5_>` Revise the directory and binary files sections when the hash sidecar file is added. (DONE)

4. `<_c5vbdaeii0ufkuufunfp6obl3_>` Revise `bnl`, `restd` sections to illustrate use of hash sidecar. (DONE)

5. `<_ejzlpg2jvbfawcsnbu1m0487v_>` Consider improving font weights in printed documents. The font used
   for source code could be a little bolder - especially the colored texts.

6. `<_dyhrrr7qbh42sjl7ssx9irgb8_>` Harmonize code colors and fonts across `lstlistings` and `pandoc` syntax coloring.
   Currently these packages use different fonts and colors.

7. `<_6r09m9nqhz2ma75ttxxhrmbhq_>` Review how to fully embed all referenced fonts in print PDFs.

8.  `<_6kfjobpvb6ikszgzq1m9t9aub_>` Consider adding a new appendix to `jod.pdf` describing how to run JOD tests. (DONE)

`[end-todo]`
