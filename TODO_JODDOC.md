==========================================================

Pending and considered changes for `JODDOC`.
The base 36 GUID key is stable over the lifetime of a task
and may appear in other TODO lists.

`[begin-todo]`

1. `<_bl6dm1o5pm6naybl09fb5zuzw_>` Consider reviewing manual text with various tools like Grammarly; it's not
   optimal for LaTeX code but I've found cases where it improves punctuation.
   The typo jihad never ends.

2. `<_ejzlpg2jvbfawcsnbu1m0487v_>` Consider improving font weights in printed documents. The font used
   for source code could be a little bolder - especially the colored texts.

3. `<_dyhrrr7qbh42sjl7ssx9irgb8_>` Harmonize code colors and fonts across `lstlistings` and `pandoc` syntax coloring.
   Currently these packages use different fonts and colors.

4. `<_6r09m9nqhz2ma75ttxxhrmbhq_>` Review how to fully embed all referenced fonts in print PDFs.
