\section{Turning JOD Dump Script Tricks}\label{ap:joddumptricks}

Dump script generation is my favorite JOD feature. Dump scripts essentially serialize 
JOD dictionaries; they are mainly used to backup dictionaries and interact with 
version control systems: see appendix~\ref{ap:jodvcsys} on page~\pageref{ap:jodvcsys}.
However, dump scripts are general J scripts and can do much more!  
Maintaining a stable of healthy JOD dictionaries is easier 
if you can turn a few dump script tricks.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Sharing code, tests and other objects:}
\item \textbf{Flattening reference paths:}
\item \textbf{Merging dictionaries:}
\item \textbf{Updating master dictionary parameters:}
\end{enumerate}
